# Open Security Development Lifecycle (OpenSDL)

<br/>

## I. Introduction

OpenSDL is an open-source initiative that addresses the growing need for a unified framework that encompasses not only secure software development but also the deployment and operation of modern services. Our mission is to bridge the gap for enterprises of all sizes, bringing the benefits of a structured security framework to all.

<br/>
<br/>

## II. Goals

### A. Education
OpenSDL's primary goal is to lay a strong foundation in cybersecurity fundamentals for practitioners across the industry. We believe that mastery of the basics can prevent the majority of security compromises. OpenSDL provides a curriculum that guides learners through self-discovery of security principles within their development and operational environments, fostering a culture of security from the ground up.

### B. Practice
The second pillar of OpenSDL is the practical application of acquired knowledge. We provide practitioners with the tools and guidance necessary to maintain a continuous cycle of:

**Awareness**: Discovering essential facts about their environments.<br/>
**Assessment**: Building a risk profile based on these facts.<br/>
**Risk Mitigation**: Addressing the most critical issues identified.

<br/>
<br/>

## III. Main Components

**Secure Software Development**: Guidelines for writing and maintaining secure code.<br/>
**Secure Deployment of Services**: Strategies for reliably deploying secure services.<br/>
**Secure Operation of Services**: Best practices for the ongoing security of operational services.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

## IV. Philosophy

OpenSDL is not just another checklist. It focuses on the core principles of secure development, deployment, and operation, encouraging a proactive stance on security rather than a reactive one. Our framework is designed to withstand the test of time and adapt to the cyclical trends of vulnerabilities.
