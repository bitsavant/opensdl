## Overview

The CCCS framework is an essential part of the OpenSDL initiative, designed to enhance the Awareness phase of cybersecurity practice. It provides a structured approach to dissecting and comprehending the infrastructure that underpins modern services, from small-scale applications to large, distributed systems. By adopting the CCCS framework, practitioners can gain a fractal-like perspective of their infrastructure, ensuring no component is overlooked.

## Layers of CCCS

Control: Manages the orchestration of system resources and configurations, encompassing management interfaces, APIs, and control plane elements.
Compute: Represents the processing environments, from physical servers to serverless functions, that execute applications and services.
Communication: Handles data exchange within the infrastructure, including networking protocols, IPC mechanisms, and API gateways.
Storage: Manages data persistence, including file systems, databases, and various storage services.

## Role in OpenSDL

### Awareness
**Systematic Discovery**: Use CCCS to methodically identify all components of your system's infrastructure.<br/>
**Documentation**: Document the identified elements within the four CCCS layers for a comprehensive view of your system's architecture.<br/>

## Integrating CCCS into OpenSDL Practices

While the CCCS framework is pivotal during the Awareness stage, its structured approach lays the foundation for effective risk assessment and mitigation. By using CCCS to achieve a holistic view of your infrastructure, you can better understand where vulnerabilities may exist and how they can be addressed.
