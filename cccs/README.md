## Overview

CCCS (Control, Compute, Communication, Storage) is a conceptual framework designed to provide a holistic, high-level view of systems. <br/>

Its primary goal is to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of any given system by categorizing its components into four distinct layers: **Control, Compute, Communication, and Storage**.

This "zoomed-out" approach ensures that no component is overlooked during the initial assessment, providing a solid foundation upon which detailed analysis can be built. The value of CCCS lies not just in its ability to aid in security assessments, but more fundamentally, in its capacity to foster a deeper understanding of systems. By first establishing an accurate high-level picture, one can then delve into the intricate details with clarity and purpose, ensuring a thorough and systematic exploration of the system.

Within OpenSDL, it is designed to enhance the Awareness phase of cybersecurity practice.

## Layers of CCCS

**1. Control**: Manages the orchestration of system resources and configurations, encompassing management interfaces, APIs, and control plane elements.<br/>
**2. Compute**: Represents the processing environments, from physical servers to serverless functions, that execute applications and services.<br/>
**3. Communication**: Handles data exchange within the infrastructure, including networking protocols, IPC mechanisms, and API gateways.<br/>
**4. Storage**: Manages data persistence, including file systems, databases, and various storage services.<br/>

## CCCS: An Analog to the OSI Model for System Architecture

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model revolutionized the way we understand and standardize network communications. By segmenting network operations into seven distinct layers, the OSI model demystified the complexities of networking, paving the way for clearer communication and collaboration among engineers and developers.

Drawing inspiration from the OSI model, the CCCS (Control, Compute, Communication, Storage) framework emerges as a modern approach to system architecture and design. While the OSI model is tailored for network communications, CCCS provides a comprehensive lens to view and design systems, encompassing their control mechanisms, computational resources, communication pathways, and storage components.

### Key Highlights:
**Layered Design Philosophy**: Both OSI and CCCS leverage a layered approach to simplify intricate concepts. While OSI focuses on network protocols, CCCS offers a blueprint for holistic system design.

**Standardizing Systems**: OSI's success lies in its standardization of network communications. In a similar vein, CCCS aims to standardize how we perceive, design, and optimize systems, fostering enhanced collaboration and understanding among tech professionals.

**Broadened Scope**: Unlike the communication-centric OSI, CCCS encapsulates a system's entirety, from its control logic to its storage solutions.
Security Through Understanding: Knowledge is the first step to security. Recognizing vulnerabilities at specific layers or components, whether in OSI or CCCS, streamlines security efforts and threat mitigation.

**Modern Response to System Complexity**: As OSI addressed the networking challenges of its era, CCCS responds to today's intricate system designs, especially in the realms of cloud computing, microservices, and distributed systems.

<br/>

By introducing CCCS as a counterpart to the OSI model, we aim to equip the tech community with a structured and standardized framework. This approach not only simplifies system design but also fosters a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay of system components.

## Role in OpenSDL

### Awareness
**Systematic Discovery**: Use CCCS to methodically identify all components of your system's infrastructure.<br/>
**Documentation**: Document the identified elements within the four CCCS layers for a comprehensive view of your system's architecture.<br/>

## Integrating CCCS into OpenSDL Practices

While the CCCS framework is pivotal during the Awareness stage, its structured approach lays the foundation for effective risk assessment and mitigation. By using CCCS to achieve a holistic view of your infrastructure, you can better understand where vulnerabilities may exist and how they can be addressed.
